            <p>I was born in Overland Park, Kansas in 1998. In 2003 I moved to Blue Springs where I finished my education in 2018 and graduated from Blue Springs High School in 2016. I have one sister, Taylor, and both of my parents are remarried. In 2016 I obtained the rank of eagle scout through The Boy Scouts of America. </p>
            <p>In high school I was very actively involved in marching band holding a position where I was doing a lot of work in the background for anything that needed to be done. Also had a lot of leadership in my role and in my section as one of the better members in the band of 300. Our band traveled to many states across the country including Georgia, California, Texas, Hawaii and Indiana</p>
